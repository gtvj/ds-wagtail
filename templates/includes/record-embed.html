                <p>The portrait shows a balding man, dark haired, rather askew of eye, and wearing a white lace collar of a type familiar to anyone who has read anything about William Shakespeare. The image itself is quite easily explained. It is a pencil copy, made in the 19th century by an antiquarian and archivist, of a 17th century portrait. But is this an image of Shakespeare, and why is it in the collections of The National Archives at all?</p>
                <p>The expert among whose papers it was found was Rawdon Lubbock Brown who, as you may have read in a blog earlier this year, was among the staff of the then-Public Record Officeâ€¦ but in Venice.</p>
