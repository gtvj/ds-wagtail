Toolkit styles
==============

When a change to a toolkit is required, change it in the toolkit SASS file. In this way we can perform a diff between
any candidate styles created for Etna and those within the toolkit. If we were to use @extend it will be harder to
identify how the code is intended to change.

This was discussed in an Etna developers meeting on 5 July 2021.
