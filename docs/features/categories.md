# Categories

The icons used by the categories snippets can be selected from a list of the svg files in the path `static/images/category-svgs/` under the categories app itself.

The reason for this is to protect from potential 500 errors should a file be deleted or renamed.

If additional category icons are required, they should be added to the directory above. Once added, icons should not be renamed or removed unless it is **absolutely certain** they are not in use by any category snippet.
