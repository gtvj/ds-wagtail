# Dependency management

## For Python/Django

The Etna project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage Python dependencies, which uses lock-file to help ensure environment consistency.

Locally, Poetry runs in the `web` container, and it's commands are invoked via the shell. To start a shell session with your local `web` container, run:

```console
$ fab sh
```

You can then run Poetry commands exactly [as they are documented here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/).

Here are the ones you'll use regularly:

### Updating local dependencies to reflect changes

```console
poetry install --remove-untracked --no-root"
```

### Adding a dependency

Use the following to automatically use the latest version:

```console
poetry add name-of-dependency
```

Or, specify a version:

```console
poetry add name-of-dependency@^2.0.5
poetry add "name-of-dependency@>=2.0.5"
```

See [the Poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#add) for more options.

### Removing a dependency

```console
poetry remove name-of-dependency
```
