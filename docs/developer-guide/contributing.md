# Contributing code

Before contributing code, please familiarise yourself with the [Project conventions](/developer-guide/project-conventions).

## General advice:

- Create pull-requests sooner rather than later: CI feedback is your friend, not your enemy.
- Mark in-progress PRs as drafts until they are ready for review.
- Don't be afraid to show your working. We're all learning. If you need help, linking to code changes in a PR is a quick and easy way to explain the problem.

## Submitting a pull request (PR)

1. Push your branch to the remote.
2. Head to https://github.com/nationalarchives/ds-wagtail/pulls and create a pull request from your branch.
For the PR Title:
    1. For ticketed features or ticketed bugs, use the naming convention: `DF-XXX: Short description`
    2. For housekeeping tasks or other unticketed work, use the convention: `Chore: Short description`
    3. See [here](/developer-guide/project-conventions#naming-pull-requests) for more information on naming.
3. To mark a PR as a draft, click the drop-down where it says **"Create pull request"** and select the **"Create draft pull request"** button instead.
4. When you are finished (and CI is passing): Add a useful description, mark the PR as "Ready to review", and request a review from another developer.
