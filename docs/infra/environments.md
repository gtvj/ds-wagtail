## Deployment guidance

1. Post to the appropriate Slack channel to check that it is okay to continue.
2. To start a deployment, push the relevant branch to the `platform` remote.
3. Update the appropriate Slack channel when the deployment is complete.
4. Update the status on the corresponding Jira ticket (where relevant).
